Warning: Provider development overrides are in effect

The following provider development overrides are set in the CLI
configuration:
 - terraform.local/local/nubes in /home/naeel/terra

The behavior may therefore not match any released version of the provider and
applying changes may cause the state to become incompatible with published
releases.

Planning failed. Terraform encountered an error while generating this plan.


Warning: Resource targeting is in effect

You are creating a plan with the -target option, which means that the result
of this plan may not represent all of the changes requested by the current
configuration.

The -target option is not for routine use, and is provided only for
exceptional situations such as recovering from errors or mistakes, or when
Terraform specifically suggests to use it as part of an error message.
